Plugins for Lenovo CNOS Telemetry
===
Network telemetry is used by organizations to monitor their network devices (e.g. switches,routers) and provide this data to software controllers to  analyze the data for condition of the network. Network Telemetry Agents running on Lenovo CNOS monitor the buffer statistics and network interface counters on the switch. Extenal Montoring and Analytical tools like Ganglia and Splunk can be used to monitor and analyse the telemetry agent data pulled from switches running Lenovo CNOS.
